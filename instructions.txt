Using Firecrawl


I want to use some LLM model which can take this raw markdown data and give me the slides from the data which can be used to make the ppt.
The LLM model's output should match the below desc.
A. Type of the slide layout that I should use for each slide. The possible layouts are
1. TITLE_AND_BODY_LAYOUT --> We have the heading for the slide and then the content of the slide
2. IMAGE_ONLY_LAYOUT --> We have the heading/Title of the slide and then we have Image to put
3. TEXT_SECTIONS_AND_CONCLUSION_LAYOUT --> We have the heading of the slide and then we have have sections which are there in some row, columns format there can n rows and m columns in the sections part.
4. TITLE_AND_TIMELINE_LAYOUT --> We have the heading of the slide and then some set of events in timeline ( time on x axis and then events )
5. TITLE_AND_TABLE_LAYOUT --> We have the title of the layout and then some table of n*m elements

2. And for each type I should have the corresponding data in json format for e.g
if layout is IMAGE_ONLY_LAYOUT then I should have title and then image url

first write the prompt
